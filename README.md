# 📱 Instagram User Analytics Project

This project analyzes user behavior on Instagram, focusing on engagement metrics and usage patterns. It simulates a real-world business scenario where SQL is used to create and analyze a structured dataset.

## 📌 Objective
To explore user engagement trends such as likes, comments, shares, saves, and identify patterns across devices and user cohorts using SQL.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **SQL** (MySQL Workbench)
- **PowerPoint** (for report)
- **Dataset** simulated via custom SQL scripts

## 🗂️ Files Included
- `create_tables.sql` – Defines the schema (users, events, email_events)
- `INSERT TABLES.sql` – Inserts initial data
- `insert_remaining_data.sql` – Completes table population
- `Project_queries.sql` – Contains all analysis queries
- `SAMPLE_SUBQUERY_QUESTION_2A.sql` – Bonus subquery (advanced insight)
- `INSTAGRAM USER ANALYTICS.pptx` – Final presentation/report with insights

## 🔍 Key SQL Analysis Tasks
- Weekly engagement analysis
- Retention by signup cohort
- Device-wise engagement breakdown
- Email engagement trends
- Metric spike investigation and insight generation

## 🧠 Insights Gained
- Identified top-performing engagement features and time-based activity patterns
- Analyzed user retention using cohort-based logic
- Practiced advanced SQL techniques like window functions, joins, and subqueries

## 📄 Report
All findings and interpretations are summarized in the presentation file:
